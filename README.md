# Advanced Data Classification Techniques for Early Detection of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis


**Overview**

This project focuses on the classification of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using machine learning techniques applied to a dataset comprising various clinical, sensory, and functional features. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to loss of muscle control. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for effective management and treatment. By leveraging data-driven approaches, this project aims to build and evaluate models that can accurately distinguish between individuals with ALS and healthy controls.


**Dataset**:

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle platform. It includes features such as demographic information, clinical metrics, sensory scores, time-dependent clinical condition indices, and functional scores. The dataset comprises of features and a target variable, 'Diagnosis (ALS)', where:

'1' indicates the presence of ALS.
'0' indicates a healthy individual.

Some important features include:

Demographic Information: ID, Sex, Age

Clinical Metrics: J1_a, J3_a, J5_a, J55_a

Sensory Scores: S1_a, S3_a, S5_a

Time-dependent Clinical Condition Index (dCCi): dCCi(7), dCCi(8), dCCi(9), dCCi(10), dCCi(11), dCCi(12)

Functional Scores: d_1, F2_i, F2_{conv}
